# At-a-glance Venue Recommendations
<a href="https://mkspainhour.github.io/WHERE/">WHERE</a> quickly suggests the activities most likely to be worth someone's time using either their current location or a provided city.

## Goals
- Minimal, spacious design that draws the users eye immediately to significant details and does not needlessly distract.
- UI components that clearly communicate their state and behavior.
- Iconography that requires minimal processing to interpret.
- Typography whose visual character is aligned with the design tone and goals of the application.

## API's Utilized
WHERE uses the Foursquare API for venue recommendations, Google's Geocoding Service for search query interpretation and coordinate fetching, the Google Maps API to aid the user in navigating to a given venue, and the National Weather Service API to help inform the users choice when applicable.
