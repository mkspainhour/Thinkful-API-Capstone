# At-a-glance Venue Recommendations
WHERE suggests venues, activities, or services that are most likely to be worth someone's time using either the users current location or a provided city.

## API's Utilized
WHERE achieves this by using the Foursquare API for venue recommendations, Google's Geocoding Service for search query interpretation, parsing, and fetching of the latitude and longitude of the specified area, the Google Maps API to assist the user in navigating to a given venue, and the National Weather Service API to help inform the users venue choice when applicable.

## Design Goals
Minimal, spacious design that draws the users eye immediately to significant details and does not distract, and iconography that requires as little thought as possible to interpret.

## User Experience Goals
Accessing as much information with as few interactions as possible and components that communicate their state and usability immediately and clearly.
