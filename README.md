# At-a-glance Venue Recommendations
WHERE quickly suggests activities most likely to be worth someone's time using either their current location or a provided city.

## API's Utilized
WHERE achieves this by using the Foursquare API for venue recommendations, Google's Geocoding Service for search query interpretation and coordinate fetching, the Google Maps API to aid the user in navigating to a given venue, and the National Weather Service API to help inform the users choice when applicable.

## Goals
- Minimal, spacious design that draws the users eye immediately to significant details and does not needlessly distract.
- UI components that clearly communicate their state and behavior.
- Iconography that requires minmal processing to interpret.
- Typography whose visual character aligns itself along the design tone and goals of the application.
